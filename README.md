# javascript node.js practice

1. Install Node.js on your computer. You can download it from their site, https://nodejs.org/en/. 

    - Also, here's a helpful YouTube video for beginner's with JavaScript, Node.js and Visual Studio Code: https://youtu.be/U-679Jd3fmQ.

1. Write a function that calculates a person's age using a Date String. Save it in a file called age.js

    - To run the code using Node: in the terminal navigate to the directory that the js file is in. If you only have one directory you may already be there. (use **pwd** to see the current directory, **ls** to list out the contents of that directory, and **cd** to change to a different directory). Once you're in the correct directory, type **node age.js** to run the file.  Anything you've console.logged will show up in the terminal.

1. Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of a word, and write a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a sentence. Name the file capitalizeFirstLetter.js.
